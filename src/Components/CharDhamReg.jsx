                            Char Dham Yatra Registration is mandatory for all
                            pilgrims traveling to Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath,
                            and Badrinath in 2026, whether by road, helicopter, palki,
                            pony, or trekking route. The Government of Uttarakhand
                            introduced compulsory registration to ensure safety,
                            crowd management, and real-time tracking.
                            Without valid registration, entry to temple premises and
                            check posts is not permitted, and travelers may face
                            delays or denial of access.

                                The registration is managed by the Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board (UTDB) and can be completed online or offline. Online registration is the most convenient way, allowing pilgrims to book their preferred dates in advance, upload identity details, and receive digital permits. Offline registration counters are available at major points like Haridwar, Rishikesh, Janki Chatti, Guptkashi, Phata, Sonprayag, Joshimath, Harsil, and Badrinath, but queues are long during peak season.
                                <br /><br />
                                Registration typically begins 1–2 months before the temple opening dates. For 2026, Char Dham temples are expected to open around late April to early May, depending on Akshay Tritiya and official announcements from temple committees. Pilgrims are advised to register early, especially for Kedarnath, as daily capacity limits apply.
